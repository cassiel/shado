* RANDOM TECHNICAL NOTES
** Hostname

- When working with more than one norns/shield device on a network, they'll need distinct names (other than ~norns.local~). As documented [[https://monome.org/docs/norns/wifi-files/#hostname][here]], change name via ~raspi-config~.

** Git

- On norns, generate a key with

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<email>"
  #+END_SRC

  Then check out: this combo seems to work:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    exec ssh-agent bash
    ssh-add
  #+END_SRC
