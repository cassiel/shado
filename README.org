* =shado-lua=

The SHADO monome rendering library in Lua for the monome norns.

** Setup

Install =luarocks= (the Lua package manager) and =luaunit= (the unit testing library). On norns:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  sudo apt-get install luarocks
  sudo luarocks install luaunit
#+END_SRC

To run the tests on macOS (with Homebrew):

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  brew install luarocks
  luarocks install luaunit
#+END_SRC

We also use the library =inspect= for some debugging in the tests; install as above.

** Unit Testing

From the =code= directory, test with

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  lua shado-lua/test-all.lua
#+END_SRC
