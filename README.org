* =shado=

The SHADO monome rendering library in Lua for the monome norns.

** Setup

Install =luarocks= (the Lua package manager) and =luaunit= (the unit testing library). On norns:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  sudo apt-get install luarocks
  sudo luarocks install luaunit
#+END_SRC

To run the tests on macOS (with Homebrew):

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  brew install luarocks
  luarocks install luaunit
#+END_SRC

We also use the library =inspect= for some debugging in the tests; install as above.

** Unit Testing

From the directory containing =shado= (on the norns that would be =/home/we/dust/code=), test with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  lua shado/test-all.lua
#+END_SRC

** Comparison with Java SHADO

- All coordinates have origin or top-left at =(1, 1)= (Lua-style) rather than =(0, 0)=.
- Rename: =ViewPort= is now called =Mask=, which is a bit snappier and more indicative of what it actually does.
